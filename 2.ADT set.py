Explanation - Sure Aryan! Here's a **line-by-line explanation** of **Assignment No. 2: ADT for Set Operations** so you understand everything clearly.

---

### ðŸ”· **`class Set:`**

Defines a class `Set` to simulate set behavior using lists.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def __init__(self):`

Initializes an empty list to store unique elements in the set.

```python
self.elements = []
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def add(self, element):`

Adds an element **only if it's not already present**, ensuring set uniqueness.

```python
if element not in self.elements:
    self.elements.append(element)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def remove(self, element):`

Removes the element if it exists in the set.

```python
if element in self.elements:
    self.elements.remove(element)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def contains(self, element):`

Checks whether the element is in the set. Returns `True` or `False`.

```python
return element in self.elements
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def size(self):`

Returns the number of elements in the set.

```python
return len(self.elements)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def __iter__(self):`

Returns an iterator so you can use the `for` loop to iterate over elements.

```python
return iter(self.elements)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def intersection(self, other_set):`

Returns a **new Set** containing elements **common to both sets**.

```python
result = Set()
for element in self.elements:
    if other_set.contains(element):
        result.add(element)
return result
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def union(self, other_set):`

Returns a **new Set** with all **unique elements from both sets**.

```python
result = Set()
for element in self.elements:
    result.add(element)
for element in other_set.elements:
    result.add(element)
return result
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def difference(self, other_set):`

Returns a **new Set** with elements in this set **but not in other\_set**.

```python
result = Set()
for element in self.elements:
    if not other_set.contains(element):
        result.add(element)
return result
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def subset(self, other_set):`

Checks if **all elements** of this set are present in `other_set`.

```python
for element in self.elements:
    if not other_set.contains(element):
        return False
return True
```

---

## ðŸŒŸ User Interaction Functions:

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def menu():`

Displays the options for user to perform different set operations.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `def main():`

The **driver function** that uses `Set` class and provides a menu to:

* Add/remove elements
* Get size
* Perform union, intersection, difference
* Check for subset
* Exit

It creates two sets: `set1` and `set2`, and allows user to manipulate them.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `if __name__ == "__main__":`

Ensures `main()` runs **only** when the script is executed directly.

Questions -
âœ… Assignment No. 2 Oral Questions with Answers
Title: Create ADT that implements the "Set" concept

ðŸ”¹ Basic Conceptual Understanding
Q1. What is a Set in data structures?
A: A set is a collection of distinct elements with no duplicates. It supports operations like insertion, deletion, search, union, intersection, difference, and subset checking.

Q2. What is an ADT (Abstract Data Type)?
A: An ADT is a logical description of how data is organized and the operations supported on that data. It hides implementation details and shows only the interface.

Q3. How is a Set ADT different from an Array or List?
A: Unlike arrays or lists, a Set does not allow duplicate elements and often doesnâ€™t maintain any particular order of elements.

ðŸ”¹ Implementation-Oriented Questions
Q4. How did you implement the Set in your program?
A: We implemented the Set using either an array or a linked list and ensured that no duplicate elements were added. We also implemented functions for add, remove, contains, and set operations.

Q5. What does the add(element) function do?
A: It inserts a new element into the set only if it is not already present.

Q6. What does the remove(element) function do?
A: It searches and removes the specified element from the set, if it exists.

Q7. What is the purpose of the contains(element) function?
A: It checks whether the specified element exists in the set and returns true or false.

Q8. How do you find the size of the set?
A: The size() function counts and returns the total number of elements currently in the set.

Q9. How did you implement the iterator() function?
A: The iterator returns access to elements one by one (e.g., using a loop), allowing traversal through the set without exposing internal structure.

ðŸ”¹ Set Theory Operations
Q10. How do you perform Union of two sets?
A: We create a new set and add all elements of both sets into it. Duplicates are automatically ignored.

Q11. How is Intersection performed?
A: By checking which elements are common to both sets, and storing those in a new set.

Q12. How do you compute the Difference between two sets A and B (A - B)?
A: We add elements from Set A into a new set only if they are not present in Set B.

Q13. How do you check if one set is a Subset of another?
A: For every element in Set A, we check if it exists in Set B. If all elements match, A is a subset of B.

Q14. What happens if we try to add a duplicate element?
A: It is ignored; sets do not allow duplicate entries.

Q15. What is the time complexity of common set operations?
A: Insertion/Deletion/Search: O(n) for array/linked list

Using hash table: O(1) on average

Using BST: O(log n)
